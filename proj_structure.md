## **PROJECT: School Management System (SMS)**

### **OVERALL ARCHITECTURE VISION**

Think of this like building a house:
- **Phase 1** = Foundation + basic rooms (you can live in it)
- **Phase 2** = Furnishing and essential utilities (comfortable to live in)
- **Phase 3** = Smart home features and upgrades (impressive to show off)

---

## **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (MVP - Get This Working First)**

### **User Roles & Permissions**
```
Admin (Superuser)
├─ Can create/edit/delete: Students, Teachers, Classes, Subjects
├─ Can assign teachers to classes
├─ Can enroll students in classes
└─ Full system access

Teacher
├─ Can view assigned classes
├─ Can view students in their classes
└─ Read-only for their data

Student
├─ Can view enrolled classes
├─ Can view their teachers
└─ Read-only for their data
```

### **Database Models (Domain Model)**

**Think of it like organizing a filing cabinet:**

```
User (Built-in Django)
├─ username
├─ email
├─ password
└─ role (Admin/Teacher/Student) → use Django Groups or custom field

Profile (extends User)
├─ user (OneToOne → User)
├─ full_name
├─ phone
├─ address
├─ date_of_birth
└─ profile_picture

Subject
├─ name (e.g., "Mathematics")
├─ code (e.g., "MATH101")
└─ description

Class (or Course)
├─ name (e.g., "Grade 10-A")
├─ subject (ForeignKey → Subject)
├─ teacher (ForeignKey → User[Teacher])
├─ academic_year (e.g., "2024-2025")
├─ students (ManyToMany → User[Student])
└─ schedule (e.g., "Mon/Wed 10:00-11:00")
```

### **Key Django Packages to Use**

**Phase 1:**
- `django-crispy-forms` → Better forms
- `pillow` → Image handling
- `python-decouple` → Environment variables

**Phase 2:**
- `django-filter` → Advanced filtering
- `openpyxl` → Excel exports

**Phase 3:**
- `reportlab` or `weasyprint` → PDF generation
- `celery` → Background tasks for emails
- `django-chartjs` or `plotly` → Charts
- `django-notifications-hq` → Notification system

---

## **DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

**Phase 1 Deployment:**
- Deploy on Railway/PythonAnywhere
- Use PostgreSQL
- Basic static file serving

**Phase 2 Deployment:**
- Add media file storage (AWS S3 or Cloudinary)
- Set up email service (SendGrid/Mailgun)

**Phase 3 Deployment:**
- Add Redis for caching
- Celery for background tasks
- CDN for static files

---

## **WORKING BACKWARD (Your Action Plan)**

Since you think backward from the goal, here's your roadmap:

**Goal:** Deployed, impressive school management system

**To get there, you need:** Phase 3 features running smoothly

**To get Phase 3, you need:** Phase 2 working perfectly

**To get Phase 2, you need:** Phase 1 foundation solid

**To get Phase 1, you need:** Start with domain models

**RIGHT NOW:** 
1. Draw your database diagram (models above)
2. Set up Django project
3. Create User model with roles
4. Build authentication system
5. Create Profile, Subject, Class models
6. Build admin dashboard (CRUD)
7. Build teacher dashboard (view only)
8. Build student dashboard (view only)
9. Deploy Phase 1
10. Then move to Phase 2

**Does this architecture make sense? Want me to help you start with Phase 1 implementation - maybe the database models or project setup?**
